# Getting Started with DomTrip

Welcome to DomTrip! This section will help you get up and running with DomTrip's XML processing capabilities.

## What is DomTrip?

DomTrip is a modern Java XML processing library that focuses on **lossless parsing** and **formatting preservation**. Unlike traditional XML libraries that lose formatting information during parsing, DomTrip preserves:

- **Whitespace** (spaces, tabs, newlines)
- **Attribute quote styles** (single vs double quotes)
- **Comment positioning**
- **Element formatting**
- **Document structure**

This makes DomTrip perfect for scenarios where you need to edit XML files while maintaining their original formatting.
